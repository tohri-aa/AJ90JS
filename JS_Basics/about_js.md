##### Uses and Roles of JS in Web Development
---
1. JS allows devs to add dynamic and interactive effect to a web page.
2. It is also usedd to manipulate content of CSS, load data from remote servers and build entire apps in the browser that are called web apps.
3. It can run outside browsers using Node.js whichh allows it to create back-end apps. JS used on the browser is used to create front-end apps.
4. It is used to build native apps and desktop apps using tools like react native, the iconic framework and electron. There's really nothhing one can't do when super good in writing JS.

##### Setting up the Developer Environment withh a Code Editor

I caught up with Ajay's video on "Everything about Github Markdown, README file, Git and GitHub". I learnt about how to properly document on Github using markdown language. Documenting would bbe so muchh easier, all thanks to Ajay!


#### Day 04
___
I already have my development environment set up. I'd be using VSCode as my preferred IDE of choice.

Development Environment
___

A development environment (DE) is a setup used by software developers to create and test software. It includes a text editor, compiler or interpreter, and other tools.

A DE can be as simple as a text editor and a compiler, or it can be a complex integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a wide range of features to help developers write, compile, debug, and test their code.

**Web Development Tools**
___
- Web dev tools allow you to test and debug the JS code.
- They are often called devtools.

- Modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera provide the devtools as built-in features.

- Devtools allow you to work with a variety of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript.


**The 'script' tag**
___

To insert JavaScript into an HTML page, you use the `script` element. There are two ways to use the `script` element in an HTML page:

>Embed JS code directly into the HTML page.

>Reference an external JS code file.
